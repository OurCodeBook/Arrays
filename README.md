# 🧠 Arrays in Java – MyCodeBook

Welcome to **Day 1 of DSA with MyCodeBook** – the perfect starting point for beginners who want to learn Data Structures using Java. This guide will help you understand **arrays**, one of the most fundamental data structures in programming.


## 📘 What is an Array?

An **array** is a collection of elements stored in **contiguous memory locations**, all of the **same data type**.

It allows you to store multiple values in a single variable and access them using an **index**.


## 💡 Why Use Arrays?

- Store multiple values efficiently.
- Use a single variable name to represent a collection.
- Backbone for more advanced structures like:
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Matrices
  - Trees and Graphs (as adjacency lists/matrices)


## 🧪 Real-Life Analogy

Think of an array as a **pencil box** with fixed compartments.

You want to carry 5 pens — instead of 5 separate holders, you use one box with 5 sections.

Each section = one element of your array.


## 🔍 Java Syntax Examples

```java
int[] arr = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
//or
int[] arr = new int[5];
arr[0] = 10;
arr[1] = 20;
// and so on...
```
